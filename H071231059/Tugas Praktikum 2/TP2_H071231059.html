          A marine maid-styled virtual maid. She is trying her very best, yet is
          still sometimes awkward and clumsy.

          Aqua is a bumbling airhead who somehow manages to become the victim of
          every joke in which she gets involved. She is also childish and prone
          to throwing tantrums, smashing her keyboard, and hyperventilating when
          things don't go as planned (which is most of the time). She enjoys
          playing pranks and causing mischief, but it almost always backfires
          because of a combination of poor planning and bad luck. To make
          matters worse, Aqua makes no attempt to avoid embarrassing situations
          to the point at which many wonder if she might actually be
          masochistic. She has asked other hololive members, including Uruha
          Rushia, to bully her on several occasions. However, while Aqua appears
          to be an incompetent crybaby, she is deceptively skilled at highly
          technical video games like Sekiro, Dark Souls, Apex Legends (Master
          rank),and League of Legends (Diamond rank). She is also a prolific
          streamer, with a record of five streams in a single day. According to
          other hololive members, Aqua is kind and responsible but extremely
          introverted while off-camera, only opening up while streaming.

          She is a virtual maid who wears a marine-themed maid uniform and a
          white mob cap decorated with an anchor though it has also been
          described as a "tissue box." Despite her name and appearance, she has
          nothing to do with water. She has purple hair (resembling a red
          onion), with twin spiral ponytails decorated with navy-blue ribbons.
          She also has a few streaks of light-blue hair in her bangs and the
          inner edge of her ponytails and a light blue ahoge. On 26 September,
          Aqua debuted with a new 2D Live costume. She now wears two large
          braids, with the two small braids on each side of her bangs from her
          original design, decorated with a light navy blue headband. Her white
          top resembles a sailor fuku, with a pastel navy blue ribbon bow, and a
          row of little buttons going down the center. She wears a high-waisted
          corset pleat skirt that extends to directly beneath her bust, styled
          with two thinner ribbon bows. She now wears plain white leggings and
          black loafers instead of leaving her legs bare and wearing kitten
          heels. Aqua's new costume comes with a removable white coat, a gray
          stuffed cat which she can carry or attach to her headband, detachable
          cat ears and a tail, and pink-tinted heart sunglasses. She also has
          the option to wear this outfit with her old head model.
